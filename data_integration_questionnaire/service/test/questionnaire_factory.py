Does your organization support an event driven architecture for data integration?
No. To be honest I do not know what event driven architecture is. Can you enlighten me?

Does your organization take more than 3 weeks for data integration between 2 systems?
Yes, we are always behind schedule.

Would you like to know more about capabilities that would cut down your integration cost and time spend for integration by 50%?
Yes, I am really interested about that.

Does your organization export data lineage to data catalog?
Nope, not yet, but we are very interested.

How many integration engineers does your team have?
Just 8

What is the scope of integration? What is the total count of source systems? What is the total count of the destination systems?
We have right now 6 source systems, including an Oracle DB, an SAP system for our raw materials, an HR system, a billing system, a customer database and a calendaring system.

Does your organization promote use of open source for data integration?
Not at the moment. We have bought into Oracle, SAP and Sage to help us. So we have not looked at anything else as of now. But we are open to new ideas.
